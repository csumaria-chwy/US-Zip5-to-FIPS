# US Zip5 to FIPS
 This repo contains a complete mapping of each US Zip to County FIPS.

This mapping was created using the Google Maps API along with multiple [other](https://github.com/bgruber/zip2fips) sources. This is being done in public interest, especially as it was difficult to believe that this information was not publicly available.
